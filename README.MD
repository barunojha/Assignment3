Hi, My name is Barun Ojha and In this git repository I've put website of my personal portfolio.

I got this opportunity to make my own personal portfolio website from 6th Gurzu Bootcamp.

It is a front-end static web application with no connection to backend.

The three main languages used to create this website are:
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. JS (JavaScript)

The HTML file is **index.html**, CSS file is **app.css** and JS file is **index.js**.
